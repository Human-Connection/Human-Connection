If no path is available the url is constructed from the route's parents names and the route's name.\\n\\nYou can provide a custom url parser function. It takes the route as the first argument, it's parents as the second and returns a string or anything that [router-link's to prop](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#to) can handle.\\n\\nWhen returning an object it might be necessary to also provide a custom is-exact function like in the example below.\\n\\n```\\n<template>\\n  <ds-menu\\n    :routes=\\\"routes\\\"\\n    :url-parser=\\\"urlParser\\\"\\n    :is-exact=\\\"isExact\\\"></ds-menu>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\n  export default {\\n    data() {\\n      return {\\n        routes: [\\n          {\\n            name: 'Introduction'\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Navigation',\\n            children: [\\n              {\\n                name: 'DsMenu'\\n              },\\n              {\\n                name: 'DsBreadcrumb'\\n              }\\n            ]\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Typography'\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Layout'\\n          }\\n        ]\\n      }\\n    },\\n    methods: {\\n      urlParser(route) {\\n        return {\\n          name: route.name\\n        }\\n      },\\n      isExact(url) {\\n        return url.name === 'Introduction'\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n## Custom name parser\\n\\nYou can customize the menu item's name by providing a name parser function.\\n\\n```\\n<template>\\n  <ds-menu\\n    :routes=\\\"routes\\\"\\n    :name-parser=\\\"nameParser\\\"></ds-menu>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\n  export default {\\n    data() {\\n      return {\\n        routes: [\\n          {\\n            name: 'Introduction'\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Typography'\\n          },\\n          {\\n            name: 'Layout'\\n          }\\n        ]\\n      }\\n    },\\n    methods: {\\n      nameParser(route) {\\n        return `My ${route.name}`\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n## Customize menu items\\n\\nYou can customize top level menu items using slots. The slot name is equal to the routes name.\\n\\nIf you want to keep the sub menu for this menu item, be sure to use the `ds-menu-item` component and pass down the `route` and `parents`
