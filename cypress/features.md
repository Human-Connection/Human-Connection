# Network Specification

Human Connection is a nonprofit social, action and knowledge network that connects information to action and promotes positive local and global change in all areas of life.

* **Social**: Interact with other people not just by commenting their posts, but by providing **Pro & Contra** arguments, give a **Versus** or ask them by integrated **Chat** or **Let's Talk**
* **Knowledge**: Read articles about interesting topics and find related posts in the **More Info** tab or by **Filtering** based on **Categories** and **Tagging** or by using the **Fulltext Search**.
* **Action**: Don't just read about how to make the world a better place, but come into **Action** by following provided suggestions on the **Action** tab provided by other people or **Organisations**.

## Features

The following features will be implemented. This gets done in three steps:

1. First we will implement a basic feature set and provide a test system to test the basic network functionality.
2. In a second step we will make our prototype publicly available with an advanced feature set including the technology and organizational structure to drive a bigger public social network.
3. In a third step all the remaining features will be implemented to build the full product.
