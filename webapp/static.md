# STATIC

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

We use it for images.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#static).
