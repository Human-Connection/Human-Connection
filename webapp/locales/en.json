Bist Du gleichzeitig bei YouTube eingeloggt, werden diese Informationen Deinem Mitgliedskonto bei YouTube zugeordnet. Wenn Du die Zuordnung mit Deinem Profil bei YouTube nicht wünschst, musst Du Dich vor Aktivierung des Buttons ausloggen. Google speichert Deine Daten (selbst für nicht eingeloggte Nutzer) als Nutzungsprofile und wertet diese aus. Eine solche Auswertung erfolgt insbesondere gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit.f DSGVO auf Basis der berechtigten Interessen von Google an der Einblendung personalisierter Werbung, Marktforschung und/oder bedarfsgerechten Gestaltung seiner Website. Dir steht ein Widerspruchsrecht zu gegen die Bildung dieser Nutzerprofile, wobei Du Dich zur Ausübung dessen an YouTube richten musst.</p><br /><p>Unabhängig von einer Wiedergabe der eingebetteten Videos wird bei jedem Aufruf dieser Website eine Verbindung zum Google-Netzwerk „DoubleClick“ aufgenommen, was ohne unseren Einfluss weitere Datenverarbeitungsvorgänge auslösen kann.</p><br /><p>Google LLC mit Sitz in den USA ist für das us-europäische Datenschutzübereinkommen „Privacy Shield“ zertifiziert, welches die Einhaltung des in der EU geltenden Datenschutzniveaus gewährleistet.</p><br /><p>Weitere Informationen zum Datenschutz bei „YouTube“ findest Du in der Datenschutzerklärung des Anbieters unter: <a class=\"hc-editor-link-blot\" href=\"https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy</a></p><h1>Verwendung von Vimeo-Videos</h1><p>Wir nutzen auch Plugins von Vimeo der Vimeo, LLC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA.</p><p>Rufst du eine Seite auf, die ein solches Plugin eingebunden hat, stellt Dein Browser eine direkte Verbindung zu den Servern von Vimeo her. Durch diese Einbindung erhält Vimeo die Information, dass Du unsere Seite aufgerufen hast, auch wenn Du keinen Vimeo-Account besitzt oder gerade nicht bei Vimeo eingeloggt bist. Deine IP-Adresse und noch einige Daten, die Dein Browser liefert, werden von Deinem Browser direkt an einen Server von Vimeo in die USA übermittelt und dort gespeichert.</p><p>Wenn Du gerade bei Vimeo eingeloggt bist, kann Vimeo die Nutzung unserer webanwendung Deinem Vimeo-Account zuordnen. Wenn Du das Plugin benutzt, wie z.B. beim Start eines Videos, werden diese Informationen ebenso an einen Server von Vimeo gesendet und dort verarbeitet.</p><br /><p>Diese Verarbeitungsvorgänge erfolgen gem.
