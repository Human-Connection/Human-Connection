# Let's change the World

## Why do we need HC Nitro?

> This Prototype tries to resolve the biggest hurdle of connecting our services together. This is not possible in a sane way using our current approach.
>
> With this Prototype we can explore using the combination of GraphQL and the Neo4j Graph Database for achieving the connected nature of a social graph with better development experience, as we do not need to connect data on our own any more through weird table structures etc.
>
> **Advantages:**

> * easier data structure
> * better connected data
> * easy to achieve "recommendations" based on actions \(relations\)
> * more performant and better to understand API
> * better API client that uses caching
>
> We still need to evaluate the drawbacks and estimate the development cost of such an approach.
