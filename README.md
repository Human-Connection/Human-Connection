Human Connection is a nonprofit social, action and knowledge network that connects information to action and promotes positive local and global change in all areas of life.

* **Social**: Interact with other people not just by commenting their posts, but by providing **Pro & Contra** arguments, give a **Versus** or ask them by integrated **Chat** or **Let's Talk**
* **Knowledge**: Read articles about interesting topics and find related posts in the **More Info** tab or by **Filtering** based on **Categories** and **Tagging** or by using the **Fulltext Search**.
* **Action**: Don't just read about how to make the world a better place, but come into **Action** by following provided suggestions on the **Action** tab provided by other people or **Organisations**.
