  This migration creates a MUTED relationship between two edges(:User) that have a pre-existing BLOCKED relationship.
  It also sets the createdAt date for the BLOCKED relationship to the datetime the migration was run. This became 
  necessary after we redefined what it means to block someone, and what it means to mute them. Muting is about filtering
  another user's content, whereas blocking means preventing that user from interacting with you/your contributions.
  A blocked user will still be able to see your contributions, but will not be able to interact with them and vice versa.
